# Pit-Stop
Author: Dylan Barrett

This is an incomplete Open Source project to be used a navigational assistance tool. Pit-Stop helps users find the most optimal detours on their road trip by considering both the shortest distance from the route alongside the user's specific needs. Every trip is split into the beginning, middle, or end of the trip. The user decides if they'd like their detour on any specific part of their road trip, then the best location is found for their trip with the limitations in mind.

This project uses OpenStreetMap as the navigational backbone for the GPS.
